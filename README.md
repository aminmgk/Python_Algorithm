# Python Shop Algorithm
This project demonstrates a Python-based program to simulate the ordering process in a shop selling mobile devices, SIM cards, and accessories. The program is designed to:

Prompt for user input with validation to ensure correct entries.
Use clear error messages and output.
Store item codes, descriptions, and prices in appropriate data structures.

## Features
### Task 1: Setting up the System
This task creates the foundational structure of the shop, allowing users to:

Select a specific phone or tablet.
Choose whether a phone is SIM Free or Pay As You Go.
Select a standard or luxury case.
Choose the chargers required (none, one, or both).
Calculate the total price for the transaction.
Output a list of the items purchased and the total price.

### Task 2: Ordering Multiple Mobile Devices
This task extends the initial setup by:

Offering the customer the option to purchase additional mobile devices.
Performing the same steps as Task 1 for each additional mobile device.
Calculating a running total for the customer.
Providing a final output of the total cost once no further devices are required.

### Task 3: Offering Discounts
This task adds a discount feature:

Apply a 10% discount on the price of each additional phone or tablet purchased.
Output the new total the customer will need to pay.
Display the amount of money saved from the discount.
